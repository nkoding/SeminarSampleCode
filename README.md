# SeminarSampleCode

This repository contains code used to explain certain coding techniques presented in my seminars, talks and workshops.

Project name format
-------------------

<seminarTitle>_<exampleID>_<exampleName>


Code base
---------

Most of the examples are written in JAVA because JAVA is like my second mother tounge. 

However the concepts are applicable to all object oriented languages.


Usage
-----

to show all steps of refactoring, i will setup local branches for each state of the project according to the chapter numbers pinned on a certain comit.

An Example:

When a talk consists of 5 chapters i will create five local branches named Chapter-1...Chapter-5 on my presentation machine.
Each branch will show the state of the project at a certain commit:
<pre>#> git checkout -b Chapter-1 6e559cb</pre>
